# URL_Generator
Just a simple program inspired by the Gyfcat urls. Designed to be used for any image or media hosting website.
To make this, I found a .txt document of three things: names, adjectives, and animals. I shortened down those lists so that each list element is 6 characters or less because it will make the URLs easier to read/type.

The format follows this structure Name"The"AdjectiveAnimal which I think is better than the Gyfcat one which is AdjectiveAdjectiveAnimal. There are 3115 names, 668 adjectives and 206 animals, so there are 428,648,920 different combinations of URLs.
